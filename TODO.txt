### General issues

- start using the github tracker


### MCFParser.py

- get inspired by Angelov's pseudocode

- add support for Pickle

- d[a][b] is faster than d[a,b], but how much?

- parsing a lattice/word graph of tokens

- add docstrings!!

- run pylint

- emptyfollowers doesn't work

- try to filter the nonempty grammar 

- add a terminal filter inspired by Kallmeyer&Maier
alternatively: just filter out the lexical rules that do not cover the input

- there's a bug somewhere in remove_emptyrules(), it fails for the
  grammar test/emptygrammar.py:

### GF.py

- better linearization algorithm

- move linearization to MCFG.py ??

- make pre{} work
